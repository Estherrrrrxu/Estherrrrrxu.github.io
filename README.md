## About

I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon, working on Generative AI, machine learning, and causal inference to improve customer experience. I earned my Ph.D. in Physical Hydrology from Johns Hopkins University in 2025, where I specialized in time series classification, uncertainty quantification, and stochastic modeling of hydrological systems.

My research bridges applied physics, statistics, and machine learning, with expertise in modeling complex dynamic systems. I develop data-driven approaches for understanding and predicting behavior in both natural and engineered systems, from watershed dynamics to large-scale customer analytics.

**Research Interests:**
- Time series classification and stochastic processes
- Bayesian uncertainty quantification
- Multi-agent learning systems
- Causal inference and machine learning at scale
- Hydrologic modeling and biogeochemical transport
