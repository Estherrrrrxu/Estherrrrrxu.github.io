title={Estimation of Focused Recharge for New Mexico Using a Soil-Water-Balance Model: PyRANA},

abstract={Determining the rate and distribution of groundwater recharge helps in water planning, sustainable development in the future, and preventing contaminants from entering the aquifer. Regional statewide in-place groundwater diffuse recharge estimation has been attempted by using a distributed-parameter soil-water-balance model that simulates recharge on the daily time-step at a resolution of 250 x 250 m. The model, which is called the Evapotranspiration and Recharge Model (ETRM), used gridded precipitation, reference evapotranspiration, and soil property data as the main inputs. Because focused recharge (i.e., transmission loss in ephemeral channels) is an important contributor to groundwater recharge in semiarid-to-arid environments, a stochastic rainfall-runoff generation algorithm was developed to substitute for the original Hortonian overland flow scheme in the ETRM runoff generation procedure. The change in the core algorithm of the ETRM made the model able to incorporate both diffuse recharge and transmission losses in the first-order basin scale into the statewide recharge estimation. Thus, Python Recharge Assessment for New mexico Aquifers (PyRANA) is proposed to be a more appropriate name for the new version of the ETRM model. PyRANA results show high recharge in the mountainous areas and the karst landscape of the state up to about 20 \% of annual precipitation. The rest of the semiarid part of the state recharged around 4 % of annual precipitation. Arid parts of the state received little in-place recharge. PyRANA recharge results are close to previous point studies conducted in southern New Mexico. The amount of focused recharge at larger scales (2nd to 3rd order streams and higher) can be calibrated on the watershed basis by comparing PyRANA runoff and flume records. The rainfall-runoff generation regime was developed using data from the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, which is under a semiarid to arid climate setting. Therefore, future work should focus on validating PyRANA by adding statistical analysis of rainfall- runoff generation procedure in the mountainous areas.},
